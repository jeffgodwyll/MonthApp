<!DOCTYPE html>

<html>  <!--   This begins the HTML document -->

<head>  <!-- The head of the document. All tags here, except the "title tag" are not visible to the human -->

	<meta charset="utf-8">  
	<!-- Meta tags: Meta elements are tags used in HTML or XHTML documents to provide structured metadata about a Web page. They are part of a web page's head section. Multiple Meta elements with different attributes can be used on the same page -->

	<title>Basic Structure</title>   <!-- The title of this document -->

	<link rel="stylesheet" href="">  <!-- a link tag, to link external style sheets -->

	<script src=""></script>         <!-- A script tag to link external JS scripts -->

</head>  							 <!-- The end of the head tag, not all TAGS are closed with a "/" -->

<body>		                         <!-- The body tag, anything between the body tag is visble to the human. This is where all your visible content goes. -->

			DOCTYPE is the first thing which should be present in an HTML5 document.<br>

			HTML5 doctype is written as <!doctype html><br> <!-- The break tag or the new line tag. Moves to another line -->
			
			'DOCTYPE' keyword is not case sensitive. So, <!doctype html> or <!DOCTYPE html>, both will do.<br>

			As soon a browser finds <!doctype html> in the starting of an HTML document, it represents the document in standard mode. If you don't use doctype in the starting of an HTML document, browser goes to the quirky mode. In that case, you may find that certain content is not being displayed the way you marked them up. So, it is a good practice to start your HTML document with a doctype.<br>

			Even if you don't use any other new HTML5 tag or feature, since the browser goes to the standard mode, you can use the doctype of html5.<br>

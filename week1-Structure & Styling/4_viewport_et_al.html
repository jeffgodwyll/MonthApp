<b>Media Queries</b>
One of the most important features of style sheets is that they specify how a document is to be presented on different media: on the screen, on paper, with a speech synthesizer, with a braille device, etc.

Certain CSS properties are only designed for certain media (e.g., the 'page-break-before' property only applies to paged media). On occasion, however, style sheets for different media types may share a property, but require different values for that property. For example, the 'font-size' property is useful both for screen and print media. The two media types are different enough to require different values for the common property; a document will typically need a larger font on a computer screen than on paper. Therefore, it is necessary to express that a style sheet, or a section of a style sheet, applies to certain media types.

	<b>Recognised media types</b><br>
	The names chosen for CSS media types reflect target devices for which the relevant properties make sense. In the following list of CSS media types the names of media types are normative, but the descriptions are informative. Likewise, the "Media" field in the description of each property is informative. <br> <hr>

<b>all</b>-
Suitable for all devices. <br>
<b>braille</b>-
Intended for braille tactile feedback devices. <br>
<b>embossed</b>-
Intended for paged braille printers. <br>
<b>handheld</b>-
Intended for handheld devices (typically small screen, limited bandwidth). <br>
<b>print</b>-
Intended for paged material and for documents viewed on screen in print preview mode. Please consult the section on paged media for information about formatting issues that are specific to paged media. <br>
<b>projection</b>-
Intended for projected presentations, for example projectors. Please consult the section on paged media for information about formatting issues that are specific to paged media. <br>
<b>screen</b>-
Intended primarily for color computer screens. <br>
<b>speech</b>-
Intended for speech synthesizers. Note: CSS2 had a similar media type called 'aural' for this purpose. See the appendix on aural style sheets for details. <br>
<b>tty</b>-
Intended for media using a fixed-pitch character grid (such as teletypes, terminals, or portable devices with limited display capabilities). Authors should not use pixel units with the "tty" media type. <br>
<b>tv</b>-
Intended for television-type devices (low resolution, color, limited-scrollability screens, sound available).
Media type names are case-insensitive. <br><br>

Media types are mutually exclusive in the sense that a user agent can only support one media type when rendering a document. However, user agents may use different media types on different canvases. For example, a document may (simultaneously) be shown in 'screen' mode on one canvas and 'print' mode on another canvas.

<div class="example">
	
<em> &ltlink rel="stylesheet" media="print" href="printer.css"&gt  </em>
<br><br>
This would target print devices and provide specific styling for the page content when it is printed. CSS3 takes the idea of media types one step further and enhances their functionality with media queries. Media queries extend the usefulness of media types by allowing more precise labeling of style sheets. This enables the content's presentation to be customized to a specific range of output devices without having to change the content itself. Sounds perfect for an existing layout that needs modifying!

You can use media queries in the media attribute of your external stylesheets to target screen width, device width, orientation, etc

	<b>Targetting Screen Sizes</b>

&ltlink rel="stylesheet"
  media="handheld, only screen and (max-device-width: 320px)" href="phone.css"&gt <br>

  In the following example, phone.css would apply to devices that the browser considers "handheld" or devices with screens <= 320px wide.Prefixing a media queries with the "only" keyword will cause non CSS3-compliant browsers to ignore the rule. <br><br>

&ltlink rel="stylesheet"
  media="only screen and (min-width: 641px) and (max-width: 800px)" href="ipad.css"&gt <br>
  The following would target screen sizes between 641px and 800px: <br><br>

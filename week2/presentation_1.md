How
much work does the user have to do to get what they want?

#### –   
What
do they expect when they click this?

you thinking of the user’s wants and needs, or your own?

### ●Usability

#### –   
Are
there any user mistakes you could prevent? (Hint: Yes, there are.)

#### –   
Have
you provided everything the user needs to know?

#### –   
Could
you get the job done with less input from the user?

## Ingredients

### ●Design

#### –

the colours, shapes, and typography help people find what they want and improve
usability of the details?

MonthApp 
=========

This is a module designed by Jeffrey Godwyll, John Awotwi and Simon Alangde Wineloya.
A module that consists of four weeks of rapid training, leading to a hackathon. Solves the problem of hackathon participant inadequacies. 
Case in point: You have people who are interested in taking part of your hackathon but have no necessary coding skills.

The Monthapp module was initiated with the hope of bridging the knowledge gap among participants by giving some sort of training.

However, this goal has grown. The Monthapp now seeks to be a fully functional tutorial geared towards rapid phonegap tutoring.
